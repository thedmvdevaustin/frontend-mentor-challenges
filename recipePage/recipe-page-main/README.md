## My process
1. putting all the elements with semantic meaning(to my current knowledge) in the html along with adding classes in the BEM naming convention
2. using a reset.css file(by Josh Comeau), bringing in the custom fonts from google font helper, and bringing in custom properties for my colors and font sizes
3. creating style for the mobile version first, by seeing what styles I would be able to reuse and apply to elements to keep my code dry(helper and utilities styles)
4. creating general styles for all the elements as needed
5. making sure the site was responsive while increasing in size to the desktop version
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
- how to utilize custom properties better
- how to import fonts that are GDPR approved
- how to reuse classes with css style instead of writing them multiple times
- utilize the gap property in grid instead of using margin

### Continued development

Still need to focus on: 
- learning more about overflow 
- getting better with responsive design
- eyeballing sizes(without a figma or sketch etc... file)
- ways to make css easier for my future self and team members
